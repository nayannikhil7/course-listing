# React Courses Application

This is a simple web application built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Redux**. It showcases a list of courses, allows users to view detailed information about each course, and provides a student dashboard to track enrolled courses. The app fetches course data from a local JSON server and includes navigation to the dashboard using React Router.

## Features

- Course Listing: Displays a scrollable list of courses fetched from a local server.
- Course Details: Shows detailed information for each course, such as instructor, duration, prerequisites, and syllabus.
- Student Dashboard: Allows students to view their enrolled courses, including course progress and the option to mark them as completed.
- Navigation: A top-right corner button and avatar on the homepage let users navigate to the student dashboard.
